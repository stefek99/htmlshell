I often found myself whipping up some quick & simple HTML page in Notepad++ for whatever.

Then I figured that being able to do something like open a new tab (because let’s face it, the browser is surely already open) and hit “htmlshell[CTRL+ENTER][CLICK][CTRL+C][ALT+TAB][CTRL+V]” was a lot easier (even if it doesn’t look that way at first glance ;) than typing out all those boilerplate tags yet again.

Thus, here we are. If you find the site useful, awesome. If you feel like adding to it here, awesome.
